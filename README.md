# Macroeconomics assignment data analytics program

This program was made for my macroeconomics class instead of manually finding the real GDP of 400 movies. It uses beautifulsoup to parse the HTML from IMDB and uses other scraped data for CPI every year. The program returns a set number of top selling movies of all time, calculated by real GDP and found on a set number of pages on the IMDB website.
